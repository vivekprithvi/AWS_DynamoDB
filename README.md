# AWS_DynamoDB
The project contains AWS Lambda function to create, update, insert and delete operations on the DynamoDB Database.

Each project is hard coded in Java 8 and is built using the gradle dependency management. We get the JAR files by building using gradle. 

The JAR files are stored inside the project and these can directly be uploaded in the AWS Lambda service to see changes in the database.

The database effect is seen in that particular region and in that particular account.
